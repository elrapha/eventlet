Getting Started
===============

There's some good documentation up at: http://eventlet.net/doc/

Here's something you can try right on the command line:

% python
>>> import eventlet 
>>> from eventlet.green import urllib2
>>> gt = eventlet.spawn(urllib2.urlopen, 'http://eventlet.net')
>>> gt2 = eventlet.spawn(urllib2.urlopen, 'http://secondlife.com')
>>> gt2.wait()
>>> gt.wait()

Also, look at the examples in the examples directory.

Building the Docs Locally
=========================

To build a complete set of HTML documentation, you must have Sphinx, which can be found at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

  cd doc
  make html
  
The built html files can be found in doc/_build/html afterward.
