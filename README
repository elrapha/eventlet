Getting Started
===============

% python
>>> from eventlet import api
>>> help(api)

Also, look at the examples in the examples directory.

Building the Docs
=================

To build a complete set of HTML documentation, you must have Sphinx, which can be found at http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

  cd doc
  make html
  
The built html files can be found in doc/_build/html afterward.
